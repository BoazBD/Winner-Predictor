Somewhere in Nov 2023 winter clock was set in israel.

between 12-11-23 to 14-11-23 (2-3 files also in 15th) there was a bug- no soccer and some runs missing

todo: check which file is screwd in 00:30 of 15-11. problem is- in some files all rows dont have option3 so athena confuses

22-11-23 to 25-11-23 html change (made outcome dive instead of span) caused to not work

New authentication method caused bug and resulted in some missing data between 06-06-24 11:00 to 08-06-24 15:00
