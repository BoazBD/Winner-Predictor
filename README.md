# Sports Betting Predictor

---

## Description
Sports Betting Predictor is a cloud-based sports betting prediction system built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It incorporates automated scraping of sports data, ETL processing, optimized LSTM model training, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration.

## Features
- **Automated Scraping:** The system automatically scrapes sports data from various sources every 15 minutes to ensure the latest data is available for analysis.
- **ETL Processing:** Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processing is performed to clean, preprocess, and prepare the scraped data for model training.
- **Optimized LSTM Model:** The system utilizes an LSTM model, optimized for sports betting prediction, to analyze historical data and make predictions on future sports outcomes.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are implemented to automate the deployment process, ensuring smooth and efficient updates to the system.

## How It Works
1. **Automated Scraping:** Sports data is automatically scraped from various sources every 15 minutes using AWS services.
2. **ETL Processing:** The scraped data is then processed, where it undergoes cleaning, transformation, and loading into a data warehouse for analysis.
3. **Model Training:** An optimized LSTM model is trained using historical sports data stored in the data warehouse. The model learns patterns and trends from past data to make predictions on future sports outcomes.
4. **Prediction Generation:** Once trained, the LSTM model generates predictions for upcoming sports events, providing insights into potential betting outcomes.
5. **CI/CD Integration:** Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines are set up to automate the deployment of updates to the system, ensuring reliability and efficiency.
